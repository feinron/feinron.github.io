<h3>Law and democracy</h3>
As a public interest lawyer, my expertise includes the U.S. Constitution, strategic democracy litigation, campaign finance, voting rights, and environmental law. 
<p>I'm Chief Counsel at <a href="https://americanoversight.org/">American Oversight</a>, where our team of dedicated lawyers fights for truth, accountability, and democracy by enforcing the public's right to government records. Previously, I <a href="https://freespeechforpeople.org/free-speech-for-people-celebrates-legal-director-ron-feins-decade-of-service-and-announces-courtney-hostetler-as-fsfps-new-legal-director/">served for a decade as the Legal Director at Free Speech For People</a>, and before that at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. </p>
<p>If you want to contact me about something American Oversight-related, please visit the <a href="https://americanoversight.org/">American Oversight</a> web site.</p>
