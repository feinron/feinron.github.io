<h3>Law and democracy</h3>
As a public interest lawyer, my expertise includes strategic democracy litigation, the U.S. Constitution, campaign finance, voting rights, and environmental law. 
<p>I'm Chief Counsel at <a href="https://americanoversight.org/">American Oversight</a>, where our team of dedicated lawyers fights for truth, accountability, and democracy by enforcing the public's right to government records. Obviously, this is my personal web page only. For official American Oversight information, or if you want to contact me about something American Oversight-related, please visit <a href="https://americanoversight.org/">American Oversight</a>.</p>
<p>Previously, I <a href="https://freespeechforpeople.org/free-speech-for-people-celebrates-legal-director-ron-feins-decade-of-service-and-announces-courtney-hostetler-as-fsfps-new-legal-director/">served for a decade as the Legal Director at Free Speech For People</a>, and before that at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. </p>
