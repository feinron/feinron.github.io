<h4>About</h4>  
<p>I'm a Boston-area public interest lawyer, activist, and writer.</p>
<p>I'm Chief Counsel at <a href="https://americanoversight.org/">American Oversight</a>, where our team of dedicated lawyers fights for truth, accountability, and democracy by enforcing the public's right to government records.</p>
<p>In my copious free time, I <a href="./fiction/index.html">write</a> fiction and comedy, and play <a href="./m.html">music</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, I <a href="https://freespeechforpeople.org/free-speech-for-people-celebrates-legal-director-ron-feins-decade-of-service-and-announces-courtney-hostetler-as-fsfps-new-legal-director/">served for a decade as the Legal Director at Free Speech For People</a>, fighting for free and fair elections, challenging corruption at the highest levels of government, and fighting the influence of unchecked corporate power and big money in politics; and before that as Assistant Regional Counsel at the New England Regional Office of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, where I received four national awards (including a National Gold Medal for Exceptional Service). I’ve clerked for two federal judges. Before law school, I worked at Microsoft (on Word and Office), on a political campaign, and in nonprofit technical consulting.</p>
