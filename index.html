<h1><b>About</b></h1>
<p>I'm a Boston-area public interest lawyer, activist, and writer.</p>
<p>By day and often also the night, I'm the Legal Director atÂ <a href="http://www.freespeechforpeople.org/">Free Speech For People</a>, where we work to fight for free and fair elections, challenge corruption at the highest levels of government, and fight the influence of unchecked corporate power and big money in politics.</p>
<p>In my copious free time, I <a href="https://ronaldfein.wordpress.com/fiction/">write<</a> fiction and comedy, and play <a href="https://ronaldfein.wordpress.com/music/">music</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, I was Assistant Regional Counsel at the New England Regional Office of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, where I received four national awards (including a National Gold Medal for Exceptional Service). I've clerked for two federal judges (in federal district court in Massachusetts, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit).</p>
<p>Before becoming a lawyer, I worked at Microsoft (on Word 95, Word 97, and Office 2000), a political campaign, and nonprofit technical consulting.</p>
